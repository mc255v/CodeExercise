No deviations from the directions

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

This was a great challenge and I had a lot fun working on it. While unfortunately my free time was limited, I'm still happy with the end result. All feedback is greatly appreciated, but I understand reviewers are busy as well. Also credit goes to [https://gist.github.com/jherax/f11d669ba286f21b7a2dcff69621eb72] for the filter.
